# titanic-data-analysis

This project involves the use of NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotlib, Seaborn and Python to analyse a dataset. 

The dataset I chose is [Titanic Dataset provided by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

This repository contains:

* copy of the dataset "titanic_data.csv"
* HTML version of the report "titanic-data-analysis.html"
* iPython notebook - used to generate the report "titanic-data-analysis.ipynb"

To use this analysis, you need Anaconda. [Download here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
